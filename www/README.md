##Hi

If you're in here, you're probably wanting to use SCSS/Grunt. Let's do that:

From **within this folder**, run the following:

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

This will install all dependencies, and start the deafult grunt task which is `watch`. This watches for changes in your `/scss`, and compiles/minifies them into `/css./style.css`. It'll also create a source map.
